## Description:
This application is a burger diary that keeps a track of burger creations you want to try and then once you have devoured a burger you can mark it accordingly. It uses a heroku server for the MySQL database, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. The app is organised according to the MVC design pattern. Node and MySQL queries the database and routes data in your app. Handlebars is used to generate the HTML.
